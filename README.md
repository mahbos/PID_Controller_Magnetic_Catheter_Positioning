PID Control for 3D Positioning
Description:

This repository provides a simple and clear implementation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller that aims to achieve precise 3D positioning of a point (or an object) based on desired X, Y, and Z coordinates. It utilizes a dynamic function to simulate the response of the object and employs separate PID controllers for each axis.

Features:

Dynamic Function (dynamic_output): Simulates how the position of the object responds to the control signals and other external factors over time.
PID Controller (PID class): A generalized implementation that accepts parameters for the proportional, integral, and derivative components, and computes the control signals based on the current value and setpoint.
Visualization: The script provides a visual representation of both the PID errors and the achieved positions over time for the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
Requirements:

numpy
matplotlib
How to Use:

Install the required libraries.
Ensure that the plant, input_scaler, and output_scaler are properly defined and instantiated. This simulation uses a plant to represent the system being controlled, and scalers to standardize input and output values.
Set desired X, Y, and Z values along with PID parameters for each axis.
Run the script. It will simulate the control process for a given number of iterations, and then plot the errors and the achieved positions over time.
Notes:

You can adjust the parameters of the PID controllers, the dynamic function, or the desired setpoints to see how they affect the performance.
The input values to the plant are adjusted based on the control signals generated by the PID controllers.
The dynamic function in this simulation helps in providing a more realistic representation of the system's behavior over time.
